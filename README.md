# Extensible

This package is heavily inpired by the extensibility patterns outlined in Miguel Castro's excellent [Pluralsight Course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/developing-extensible-software) AND the Extensibility work done on [csharpfritz'](https://github.com/csharpfritz) [CoreWiki](https://github.com/csharpfritz/CoreWiki) project and aims to slightly reduce the boilerplate code required project to project... yes, i'm incredibly lazy.

Extensible is compatible with .NET Framework versions 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 while currently there is only support for .NET Standard 2.0 (Happilly accept help to get 1.0 running)
